Above, you'll see a picture of a person pressing in a button. We as humans understand this experience: if we apply force to the part of the button that's sticking out, that part will be pressed back until it hits a stopping point, which in turn triggers an action that we can see. On the internet, we use virtual buttons to stimulate actions on our computer that will change what is going on on the screen.

But how could that feel like a human experience and not a completely foreign one?

This is where the digital humanities comes in: people have written code in order to translate real life situations (like button pushing) onto the digital realm while keeping a part of that human feeling.

When you hover your mouse over certain buttons, the color gets darker and gives off the illusion of depth. This ineraction feels more human than a button that doesn't change at all because it mimics the depth/change that comes with pushing a button in. A human would feel much more comfortable using this button because there is a situational familiarity connected to it. Thus, digital humanities emulates real life by creating experiences as similar to real life as possible.
