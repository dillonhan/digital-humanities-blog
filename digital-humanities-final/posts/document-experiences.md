One example of what digital humanities is is the how it helps us understand each other as humans. As the majority of humanities are based around the studies of language and how we can understand each other, it comes as no surprise that innovations in the digital world have centered around this communication.

Take the screenshot above, for example. In this situation, someone who speaks English is having a health crisis in a country where English is not spoken. They may not have time to purchase a translation dictionary or scour the town looking for shops that sell insulin, and so they are crunched for time.

This is where the digital humanities come in handy. With the digital translator tool provided by Google, the user is able to communicate a message in another language clearly and correctly. Not only is the message correct, but oftentimes it is communicated with easy-to-use terminology that is not too stiff or scholarly.

With the progression of digital humanities, we no longer have to worry about getting completely stuck with a language barrier if we have the right technology with us. It has allowed for people to talk with others at a fluency that would have taken years to master, but can be harnessed by simply visiting a website.
