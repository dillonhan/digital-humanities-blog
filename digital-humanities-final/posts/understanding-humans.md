A major part of the humanities is the art of documenting experiences. This is one of the major reasons why language was created: with the ability to record stories, humans have been able to understand why things are the way they are and how people act.

In our day, innovations in digital humanities have lead to the creation of a heightened version of experience documentation: social media. Take a look at the front page of my Facebook profile above: what does it tell about me?

Just from one page of my profile, you can learn what city I'm in, where I'm from, what my hobbies are, what I look like, and other people I may know. These are pieces of information that usually would take a lot longer to explain than one page, but now have been consolidated into one.

This is how social media has revolutionized the way we document our experiences. Not only are all of the posts we share available in one place, but we can post pictures, videos and other multimedia that share even more information with others online. The digital humanities keep the same principles that the humanities hold, but allow for an even broader reach and ease of access than spoken word and print can.
